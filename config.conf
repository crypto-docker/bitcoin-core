# Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc call.
txindex=1

[rpc]
# Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands.
server=1
# Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. This option is ignored unless -rpcallowip is also passed. Port is optional and overrides -rpcport. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6. This option can be specified multiple times. (default: 127.0.0.1 and ::1 i.e., localhost, or if -rpcallowip has been specified, 0.0.0.0 and :: i.e., all addresses)
rpcbind=0.0.0.0
# Username and hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The field <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>. RPC clients connect using rpcuser=<USERNAME>/rpcpassword=<PASSWORD> arguments. You can generate this value with the share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py script in the Bitcoin Core repository. This option can be specified multiple times.
rpcauth=btcuser
# Listen for JSON-RPC connections on this port
rpcport=8332
# Allow JSON-RPC connections from specified source. Valid for <ip> are a single IP (e.g. 1.2.3.4), a network/netmask (e.g. 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0) or a network/CIDR (e.g. 1.2.3.4/24). This option can be specified multiple times.
rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0

[wallet]
# Specify wallet database path. Can be specified multiple times to load multiple wallets. Path is interpreted relative to <walletdir> if it is not absolute and will be created if it does not exist.
wallet=/data/wallets
# Execute command when a wallet transaction changes (%s in cmd is replaced by TxID)
walletnotify=/data/scripts/walletnotify.sh\ %s


# [Sections]
# Most options automatically apply to mainnet, testnet, and regtest networks.
# If you want to confine an option to just one network, you should add it in the relevant section.
# EXCEPTIONS: The options addnode, connect, port, bind, rpcport, rpcbind and wallet
# only apply to mainnet unless they appear in the appropriate section below.

# Options only for mainnet
